            <h2 class="stroked-text">Creating a Path Forward</h2>
            <p class="stroked-text">You schedule a meeting with the MDE advisor to discuss your situation. The advisor takes a look at your transcript and proposes a potential plan of study based on your current coursework.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">The advisor mentions that the MDE program has easier grade requirements in the courses you are currently struggling with, alleviating some stress. They assure you that it's possible to graduate in less than 1.5 years, but you'll be taking several seminar-based courses, including ones you've already taken in your previous major.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">The advisor introduces you to a couple of interesting courses:</p>

            <ul class="stroked-text">
                <li>IDE 385: Design Methodologies for Diverse Stakeholders </li>
                <li>IDE 301: Interdisciplinary Engineering Professional Seminar</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="stroked-text">These courses focus on the design process applicable across various fields and enhancing your engineering decision-making skills. IDE 301 also involves revamping resumes and provides networking opportunities.</p>

            <div class="adventure-path">
                <p class="stroked-text">Accept the advisor's plan and officially change your major to Multidisciplinary Engineering.</p>
