            <p class="stroked-text">Sitting in your capstone class, you reflect on the diverse courses that have shaped your Multidisciplinary Engineering (MDE) experience.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">From acoustical engineering to educational engineering, each course has contributed to your ability to approach problems from different angles. The emphasis on real-world applications has been a constant thread throughout your journey. Recalling back to when you took IDE 301 you remember the lessons learned about from a range of professional topics and support the
                development of your professional skills and overall engineering capabilities to IDE 487 where you learned about the emphasis of teamwork, professional and ethical responsibility, communication, impact of
                engineering in context, lifelong learning, impact of contemporary issues, and leadership but also IDE 385 where you learned about how to find and generate engineering solutions for diverse stakeholders while also cultivaiting your design philosophy. </p>

            <p class="stroked-text">As you prepare for the capstone project, you can't help but appreciate how the MDE program has equipped you with a broad skill set, allowing you to navigate through complex challenges that span multiple disciplines. You were able to learn about different design thinking mindsets such as persective-taking, iterative thinking, compassionate design, etc which proved useful during job interviews when asked to explain your background and your engineering approach to problems </p>
