            <p class="stroked-text">As you delve into your Capstone Design Project, you find yourself facing a challenge that demands your multidisciplinary engineering expertise. The capstone is the culmination of your MDE journey, an opportunity to apply all that you've learned.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">In the Spring 2023 Cohort, you're presented with three compelling design challenges. Each challenge requires a multidisciplinary approach and innovative thinking. The success of your design will depend on your ability to collaborate across various engineering and non-engineering domains.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">The design challenges for the Spring 2023 Cohort are:</p>

            <ol class="stroked-text">
                <li>How can we help increase mobility for elderly people, reduce the stigma behind using devices to help with mobility, and make those devices more accessible?</li>
                <li>How can we prevent people from experiencing detrimental effects to their health due to noise pollution, increase awareness of the dangers of noise pollution to people who live in urban areas, and make noise pollution solutions affordable?</li>
                <li>How can we increase user agency in regard to identifying and speaking about mental health warning signs, training, and resources?</li>
                <li>How can we prevent crab traps from being lost or forgotten, contributing to ocean waste and ecosystem damage?</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="stroked-text">Your journey in the MDE program has prepared you for this moment. It's time to tackle these challenges, apply your skills, and make a meaningful impact.</p>
