            <p class="stroked-text">In IDE 385, you start exploring how design principles can be applied to your interests in mechanical engineering. The course encourages you to think creatively, consider diverse perspectives, and apply a human-centered approach to problem-solving.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">One of the projects in class inspired an idea to redesigning a mechanical system using the design thinking process. You find yourself incorporating not only the technical aspects but also considering the user needs, user experience, sustainability, and social impact.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">As you delve into the project, you realize the potential for innovation when combining the principles learned in IDE 385 with your mechanical engineering background. The experience opens up new possibilities and perspectives, reshaping your approach to engineering.</p>
