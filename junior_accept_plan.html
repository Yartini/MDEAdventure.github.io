            <p class="stroked-text">You've accepted the advisor's plan, and the next semester begins. One of the courses you're enrolled in is IDE 385: Design Thinking and Communication. At first, you find the course content to be different from the traditional engineering courses you've taken. The emphasis on design methodologies for diverse stakeholders, including need-finding, immersion, persona creation, and more, feels unfamiliar.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">Initially, you may not be fully engaged, finding the coursework relatively easier compared to your previous mechanical engineering classes. However, as the semester progresses, you begin to see the value in combining these design principles with your interests in mechanical engineering.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">The course introduces you to self-awareness practices, channeling empathy, and understanding the importance of considering diverse perspectives in the design process.</p>

            <div class="adventure-path">
                <p class="stroked-text">Explore how these design principles can be applied to your interests in mechanical engineering.</p>
