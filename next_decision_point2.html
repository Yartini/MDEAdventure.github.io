            <p class="stroked-text">You've navigated through the exploration of Civil Engineering and the MDE program, reflecting on your interests and goals. Now, it's time to consider your next steps:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="stroked-text">Do you feel a strong connection with the Civil Engineering program?</span></li>
                <li><span class="stroked-text">Are you intrigued by the unique opportunities offered by the MDE program?</span></li>
                <li><span class="stroked-text">Consider scheduling a meeting with your academic advisor to discuss your findings and seek guidance on your academic path.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Additional scenario -->
            <p class="stroked-text">Feeling a bit uncertain after your classmates expressed confusion about the MDE program, you decide to take matters into your own hands. You approach a few classmates and ask them about their majors. As you share your interest in both Civil Engineering, aspects of chemical engineering, and the MDE program, you notice the confusion on their faces.</p>

            <p class="stroked-text">Realizing that watching videos might not have been enough, you decide to take proactive steps. You schedule a meeting with the MDE program advisor to get more insights and clarify any questions you have.</p>
